## Database Explorer

The Neo4j Database Explorer provides a comprehensive interface to explore your neuroanatomy database:

### Features:
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: D3.js-powered network graphs showing nodes and relationships
- **Real-time Search**: Search through nodes by properties with instant results
- **Node Labels Browser**: Browse all node types (Sensation, SpinalLevel, artery, body, nerve, vertebra)
- **Relationship Explorer**: Explore various neurological pathways and connections
- **Detailed Node Information**: View properties and relationships for individual nodes
- **Database Statistics**: Overview of total nodes, relationships, and data distribution
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter graphs by node labels and relationship types

### Access:
Visit `/explorer` endpoint to access the database explorer interface.

## Setup

### For Node.js Server (Static Files):
